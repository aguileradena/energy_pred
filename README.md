## A machine learning exercise using Germany's energy production and consumption data.

In this repository you will find the files I created to make Machine Learning time series forecast of energy production in Germany, as well as a country profile on historical energy consumption and production.I used historical energy data from Germany and other countries, taken from the open-source database created and mantained by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy). Then, I use xgboost to create a forecast of Germany's energy generation, using the free-to-use data from the [European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (entso-e)](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/dashboard/show), which is available with 15 minute intervals.

The notebooks available here are a work in progress, and I will update them in the coming weeks.
